# Learning outcomes

By the end of this practical you should be able to:

- Explain the use of and differences between Git and GitHub.
- Create an repository open source where you will work the workshop.

Those are the days where you say yourself that <br>
it won't happen again..

Nevertheless, it arrives that you do it again and again..

## Methods for tracking versions

- No tracking
  - Good luck!

-  Have a sytematize technique in your mind
  - Good luck!
  
- .content-box-green[Formal version control]
  - Easy to study changes back in time
  - Easy to jump back and test

---

# Formal version control

- It is not strictly necessary for *reproducibility*, but it can be hugely useful for *sanity* (and for managing collaborative projects, and for long-term efficiency).

The promise with formal version control:
.pull-left[
- Can make it easier to explore the history of changes.
- Enables you to go back to an earlier state to find the source of a bug
- Allows you to try things out without worrying about breaking the things that work.
- Can make it easier to incorporate changes from collaborators, even if you’re all making simultaneous changes to the same set of files.

# Using Git

.pull-left[
**Git is a version control system**. 

- Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. 

- Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a **repository** – in a sane, highly structured way.

.infobox.tip[
If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as the **“Track Changes”** features from Microsoft Word on steroids
]

# Why use Git

- It's fast.
- You don't need access to a server.
- Amazingly good at merging simultaneous changes.
- Open science is using it.

## Attention

.infobox.caution[

Git normaly use command line tools (aka `Terminal` commands).
For the purpose of this workshop, we are not going to use this tools directly.

However, we suggest that people interested get to know on the subject

Take a look at: 
- [Git's Official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/git-intro.html)
]

# What is Github?
--

.pull-left[

- Github is like *facebook for programmers*. Everyone’s on there. 
- Interface for exploring git repositories.
- You can look at what they’re working on and easily per use their code and make suggestions or changes.

- **Real** open source.
  - immediate, easy access to the code
  
- Free 2-year 'micro' account for Students
  - [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/)  
]

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, out.width='30%'}

```

.content-box-green[
If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as **DropBox** but much, much better !.

# Why Github?

- **It takes care of the server aspects of git**.
- **Graphical user interface for git**.
  - Explore the contente and its history.
  - Tracking issues
- **Facilitates**:
  - Learning from others
  - Seeing what people are up to
  
- **Lowers the barrier to collaboration**
  - *"There is an error in your document" Vs "Hey!, here is a correction for you document"*

# Is Github going to hurt me ?

Yes, 

-- 
Version control is a tough sell.
--

It requires a big initial investment in time and effort, initial experiences are often rocky, and the advantages are mostly long-term.

**but**

--
.content-box-green[
We'll start baby steps by putting a single project under version control.

# Hands on the Workshop

.assignment.infobox[
1. Create an account using your UL email at the Github plateform (It’s free!): https://github.com
  - Eventuelly you can demand for the [advantages as Student of UL](https://education.github.com/)  

1.  Choose your **Username**. You might want to give some thought about it<sup>1</sup>.

  - This site will present the projects that eventually you will work. Make it professional!. You will able to valorise in your CV. 
  - Put your photo, a description of who you are.
  - Use a professional username (see the recommendations).

## Fork Repository of the workshop

- You have `fork` the [Repository of the course](https://github.com/fabbiocrux/RR-workshop) using your Github account.

```{r include=TRUE,  out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Fork-00.png')
```


```{r, include=TRUE}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 0,right = 0)
```

# Thre main concepts on Github

1. Make a `Commit`.

2. Add a `Comment changes`

3. `Push` your change to the repository

# Change `README.md`

[Learn `Markdown` language in 10 min.](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) 

```{r include=TRUE,  out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Markdown.png')
```

1. Add the information on `README.md`.
2. Make a `commit`


```{r, include=TRUE}
countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 0,right = 0)
