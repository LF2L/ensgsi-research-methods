# (PART\*) Course information {-}

# Purpose {-}

This is an introductory workshop to the use of open-source software on data analysis and data visualization using Rstudio tools. 
We try to make it as easy and ongoing as possible, even for those who are not familiar with programming language. 

* Nevertheless, we understand that the introduction of new tools can have been challenging in this *Virtual courses*.


## Intended course learning outcomes {-}

At the end of the session, we promise that you will be able to:

* Understand the process of create reproducible documents
* Have a first insight in the data visualization practices using datasets
* Experience the diversity of options that open practices offers to communicate your results. 

::: {.infobox .tip data-latex="{note}"}
There are many references and information  within this practical workshop book and **we do not expect you to read everything we link to**. 

However, this is a first step in order to get competence in the data analysis as it is required in a world of artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data. 

Do be scare to use different tools other than Excel for analyzing data. 
You should look at each exercise, go through step by step, and understand the concept behind each sprint. 

Good luck!

## How to use this guide {-}

Before we start, take some minutes learning how to read this online book. 
The first element is to understand this website. 

In the top right of this webpage you will see this tools bar:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "600pt", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('general_images/Book_controls.png')
```

From left to right these buttons will let you:

* <i class="fa fa-bars fa-lg"></i> control the side bar

* <i class="fa fa-search fa-lg"></i> search the entire book for a specific word

* <i class ="fa fa-font settings fa-lg"></i> change the text size, font, colour

* <i class ="fa fa-edit fa-lg"></i> propose an edit if you see a mistake that I can review

* <i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> view the webpage in the 'raw' RMarkdown format, we cover RMarkdown in the course 

* <i class="fa fa-info" fa-lg></i> information about shortcuts for this book and most others like it

In addition the <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> icon in the top right of the page takes you to the GitHub repository for this book, we cover GitHub in the course, but it's basically where the online files for the book are stored.



## Self guided learning {-}

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

The lectures and practicals of this worskshop only form a part of the learning process. 
You are invited to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. 
We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommendations and fully engage with the world of open-science and visualisation techniques.
