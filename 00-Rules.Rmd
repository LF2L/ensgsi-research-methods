# Rules of the Game {-}

Imagine this module as a marathon with many **sprints** (using Agile methodology jargon `r emo::ji("smile")` !).
Therefore,the purpose is that each exercise will give you a particular concept, with a particular result at the end.

A presentation will be delivered first to introduce the basic concepts and to show the purpose of the tool.
Then, you will have a tutorial with step-by-step instructions you can go through.
