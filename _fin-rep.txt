* The mean life expectancy across all years for France?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(lifeExp))
```

* Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
gapminder %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarise( Min.Value = min(gdpPercap),
                                              Max.value = max(gdpPercap) )
```

* Look at the spread of GDP per capita across countries within the continents.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
gapminder %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarise( Min.Value = min(gdpPercap),
                                              Max.value = max(gdpPercap) )
```

* How does life expectancy vary across different continents? (Using a `ggplot`)

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
gapminder %>%
  ggplot( aes(y=lifeExp, x =continent ) ) + geom_boxplot()
```



* Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy - you decide - a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.

* Make up your own!
