We give you a warm welcome to the module of reproducible research for in ENSGSI master course. We care for open science and open practices. Thus, this website is hosted on GitHub, a open source plateform, where you will find the source documents and holds all the practical instructions and data. Acknowledgements and Inspirations This an introductory workshop on open-data science course. Thus, we have taken inspiration of many people around the world and we thank to the following people (list not exhaustive) who have either contributed or provided code in repositories that have helped us style this book: Alison Presmanes Hill rstudio4edu Hadley Wickham Desir√©e De Leon Yihui Xie Twitter for R programmers Julia Silge Jenny Bryan Garrick Aden‚ÄëBuie The R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desir√©e De Leon. You can find Allison‚Äôs images on the stats illustration GitHub repository and Desir√©e‚Äôs on the rstudio4edu GitHub repository. I (Fabio) have certainly learnt a lot from their open code repositories! https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Fabio-Cruz/‚Ü©Ô∏é https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Giovanny-Arbelaez/‚Ü©Ô∏é https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/people/Mauricio-Camargo/‚Ü©Ô∏é "],["purpose.html", "Purpose Intended course learning outcomes How to use this guide Self guided learning Noticed a mistake? We practice what we preach!", " Purpose This is an introductory workshop to the use of open-source software on data analysis and data visualization using Rstudio tools. We try to make it as easy and ongoing as possible, even for those who are not familiar with programming language. Nevertheless, we understand that the introduction of new tools can have been challenging in this Virtual courses. Intended course learning outcomes At the end of the session, we promise that you will be able to: Understand the process of create reproducible documents Have a first insight in the data visualization practices using datasets Experience the diversity of options that open practices offers to communicate your results. There are many references and information within this practical workshop book and we do not expect you to read everything we link to. However, this is a first step in order to get competence in the data analysis as it is required in a world of artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data. Do be scare to use different tools other than Excel for analyzing data. You should look at each exercise, go through step by step, and understand the concept behind each sprint. Good luck! How to use this guide Before we start, take some minutes learning how to read this online book. The first element is to understand this website. In the top right of this webpage you will see this tools bar: From left to right these buttons will let you: control the side bar search the entire book for a specific word change the text size, font, colour propose an edit if you see a mistake that I can review view the webpage in the ‚Äòraw‚Äô RMarkdown format, we cover RMarkdown in the course information about shortcuts for this book and most others like it In addition the icon in the top right of the page takes you to the GitHub repository for this book, we cover GitHub in the course, but it‚Äôs basically where the online files for the book are stored. Self guided learning It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally ‚Äî Hadley Wickham ((hadleywickham?)) 11. Februar 2015 The lectures and practicals of this worskshop only form a part of the learning process. You are invited to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommendations and fully engage with the world of open-science and visualisation techniques.

"],["rules-of-the-game.html", "Rules of the Game Assignments for ARCHE Plateform", " Rules of the Game Imagine this module as a marathon with many sprints (using Agile methodology jargon üòÑ !). Therefore,the purpose is that each exercise will give you a particular concept, with a particular result at the end. Each sprint will consist on a practical task to do. A presentation will be delivered first to introduce the basic concepts and to show the purpose of the tool. Then, you will have a tutorial with step-by-step instructions you can go through. Assignments for ARCHE Plateform After that, several questions need to be answered at the end of the tutorial. A pdf document with the results are going to be upload to the ARCHE Platform to evaluate the comprehension of the module. You will need to upload the following results.

Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents. Look at the spread of GDP per capita across countries within the continents. How does life expectancy vary across different continents? (Using a ggplot) Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy - you decide - a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year. Make up your own!
